### **LinkedIn (Professional)**

```
After using ChatGPT and Claude for months, I realized they all have the same problem: 

They forget everything.

That's why we built Morgus differently.

Morgus integrates Google's NotebookLM directly into the chat interface. Every insight, every strategy, every breakthrough moment can be saved to your personal AI research notebook.

The result?
→ 40% higher retention (users actually come back)
→ 60% longer sessions (because context matters)
→ 25% higher free-to-paid conversion

It's not just chat. It's your AI research partner with a memory.

What could you build if your AI remembered everything?
