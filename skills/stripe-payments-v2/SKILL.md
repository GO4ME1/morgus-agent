## 🔮 The Morgus Touch: Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Build First, Monetize Later** | We enable you to build and test your entire application, including payment flows, before you even sign up for a Stripe account. |
| **Secure by Default** | We use best-in-class security practices to protect you and your customers. We never handle raw credit card data directly. |
| **AI-Driven, Human-Approved** | Morgus acts as your personal payments specialist, but you have the final say. You can review and approve every step of the process. |
| **Production-Ready from Day One** | We build with the end in mind. Every integration is built on a foundation of best practices for reliability and scalability. |

## 🗺️ The Stripe Integration Workflow

### Phase 1: The "Build First, Sign Up Later" Sandbox

1.  **Tell Morgus your goal:** Simply state what you want to sell.
    > "I want to sell a premium subscription to my book club for $10/month."
2.  **Morgus creates a Stripe claimable sandbox:** This is a temporary, fully-featured Stripe account that requires no initial signup. Morgus will automatically configure your products, prices, and subscription plans in this sandbox.
3.  **Test your payment flow:** You can test the entire checkout process, including subscriptions and payment confirmations, in the live preview of your application using Stripe's test card numbers.

### Phase 2: Going Live

1.  **Tell Morgus you're ready to go live:**
    > "I'm ready to go live with payments."
2.  **Claim your Stripe account:** Morgus will prompt you to "claim" the sandbox, which involves creating your official Stripe account and completing their secure Know Your Customer (KYC) process.
3.  **All configurations are transferred:** All the products, prices, and configurations that Morgus created in the sandbox are seamlessly transferred to your new, permanent Stripe account.

### Phase 3: Managing Payments

-   **Customer Portal:** Morgus can create a customer portal where your users can manage their subscriptions, update their payment methods, and view their payment history.
-   **Webhooks:** Morgus will set up the necessary webhooks to ensure seamless communication between your application and Stripe for events like successful payments, failed payments, and subscription cancellations.
