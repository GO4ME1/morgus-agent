# Morgus Skill: Meeting Notes Transformer v2.0

## Description

This skill transforms raw, unstructured meeting notes into a professional, organized summary. It identifies action items, key decisions, and discussion points, and formats them into a clean, readable document.

## Core Principles

- **Clarity from Chaos**: Bring structure to messy notes.
- **Action-Oriented**: Highlight action items and owners.
- **Professional Formatting**: Generate a polished document suitable for sharing.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Ingest the Notes**: Morgus takes the raw notes as input (text, audio transcript, etc.).
2.  **Analyze the Content**: Morgus uses NLP to identify:
    - Action items (and assignees if mentioned)
    - Key decisions made
    - Main topics of discussion
    - Unresolved questions
3.  **Generate the Summary**: Morgus creates a structured summary with sections for each of the above.
4.  **Format the Output**: The summary is formatted in Markdown for easy reading and sharing.
