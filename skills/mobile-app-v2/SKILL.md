| **Native Performance** | Build true native applications, not web wrappers, for the best possible performance and user experience. |
| **Modern & Maintainable** | Use a modern, popular, and well-supported tech stack to ensure the generated code is easy to maintain and extend. |
| **Full-Stack Capability** | Integrate with backend services, databases, and authentication to build full-featured applications. |

## Technology Stack

Morgus uses the following technology stack for mobile app development, mirroring the best practices of top development teams:

| Component | Technology | Description |

| **UI/UX Design** | Create beautiful, intuitive, and responsive user interfaces based on modern design principles. |
| **Backend Integration** | Connect to databases, APIs, and other backend services to build dynamic, data-driven applications. |
| **Push Notifications** | Implement push notifications to engage and retain users. |
| **App Store Deployment** | Generate the necessary builds and assets for submission to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. |

## Workflow

1. **Project Initiation**: The user describes the desired mobile app in natural language.
2. **Plan & Refine**: Morgus presents a detailed development plan, including screens, features, and tech stack, for user approval.
3. **Scaffolding & Building**: Morgus scaffolds the project, writes the code, and sets up the development environment.
4. **Live Preview & Iteration**: The user can see a live preview of the app and request changes using natural language.
5. **Deployment**: Morgus generates the final build files for deployment to the app stores.
