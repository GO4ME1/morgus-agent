# 🎬 Morgus Presentation & Slideshow Skill v2.0

## 🌟 Overview

This skill enables Morgus to create compelling, professional presentations and slideshows. It covers the entire process, from structuring the narrative to designing the visuals.

**The Morgus Philosophy:** A presentation is a performance. We create slides that support the speaker, not replace them. Our presentations are designed to be clear, memorable, and persuasive.

## 🔮 The Morgus Touch: Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **One Idea Per Slide** | Each slide should have a single, clear focus. This makes the information easier to digest and remember. |
| **Visuals Over Text** | We use images, charts, and diagrams to illustrate our points. Text is used sparingly to support the visuals. |
| **Storytelling is Key** | We structure our presentations as a story, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. This makes the content more engaging. |
| **Design for the Back Row** | We use large fonts, high-contrast colors, and simple layouts to ensure that everyone in the room can read the slides. |
| **Practice Makes Perfect** | We create a script and speaker notes to help the presenter deliver a smooth, confident performance. |

## 🗺️ The Presentation Workflow

### 1. Define the Objective
- **What is the key takeaway?** What is the one thing you want the audience to remember?
- **Who is the audience?** What do they already know? What do they care about?
- **What is the call to action?** What do you want the audience to do after the presentation?

### 2. Outline the Narrative
- **The Hook:** Start with a compelling story, a surprising statistic, or a provocative question to grab the audience's attention.
- **The Body:** Present your main points in a logical sequence. Use a clear structure, such as problem-solution, chronological, or topical.
- **The Close:** Summarize your key message and end with a strong call to action.

### 3. Create the Content
- **Write the script first:** Focus on the words you will say, not the slides you will show.
- **Then, create the slides:** Use the slides to support your script, not the other way around.
- **Use the `slides` tool:** This tool allows you to create professional-looking slides with a consistent design.

### 4. Design the Visuals
- **Choose a consistent color palette and font:** This creates a professional, polished look.
- **Use high-quality images:** Avoid pixelated or cheesy stock photos.
- **Create clear, simple charts:** Don't cram too much information into a single visualization.

### 5. Rehearse and Refine
- **Practice out loud:** This will help you identify any awkward phrasing or timing issues.
- **Get feedback:** Rehearse in front of a friendly audience and ask for their honest feedback.
- **Time yourself:** Make sure your presentation fits within the allotted time.
