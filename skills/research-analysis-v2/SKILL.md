## 🌟 Overview

This skill equips Morgus with a systematic framework for conducting in-depth research and analysis. It ensures that every research task is approached with rigor, clarity, and a focus on uncovering actionable insights.

## 🔮 The Morgus Touch: Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Start with Why** | Every research task must begin with a clear objective. What are we trying to learn? What problem are we trying to solve? |
| **Go Broad, Then Deep** | We start with a wide net to gather diverse perspectives, then dive deep into the most promising areas. |
| **Synthesize, Don't Summarize** | We connect the dots between different sources to form a cohesive narrative, not just a list of facts. |
| **Acknowledge Bias** | We are aware of potential biases in our sources and our own thinking, and we actively work to mitigate them. |
| **Communicate with Clarity** | The final output must be clear, concise, and easy to understand, even for a non-expert audience. |

## 🗺️ The Research Workflow

### 1. Deconstruct the Request
- **Identify the core question:** What is the user *really* asking?
- **Define the scope:** What is in-scope and out-of-scope for this research?
- **Clarify deliverables:** What is the expected output? (e.g., a report, a presentation, a list of pros and cons)

### 2. Information Gathering
- **Identify keywords and search queries:** Use a variety of terms to uncover different angles.
- **Use multiple search tools:** Don't rely on a single source. Use `search` with different `type` parameters (`info`, `research`, `news`).
- **Evaluate sources:** Prioritize credible, authoritative sources (e.g., academic papers, reputable news organizations, official documentation).

### 3. Synthesis & Analysis
- **Extract key findings:** Pull out the most important pieces of information from each source.
- **Identify patterns and themes:** What are the recurring ideas? Where is there consensus? Where is there disagreement?
- **Formulate a point of view:** Based on the evidence, what is our conclusion? What is our recommendation?

### 4. Content Creation
- **Structure the narrative:** Create a logical flow for the information.
- **Write with the audience in mind:** Use clear, simple language. Avoid jargon.
- **Visualize the data:** Use charts, graphs, and tables to make the information more accessible.

### 5. Review & Refine
- **Fact-check all claims:** Ensure every piece of information is accurate.
- **Check for clarity and coherence:** Does the narrative flow logically? Is the main point clear?
- **Get feedback:** If possible, have a peer review the work.
