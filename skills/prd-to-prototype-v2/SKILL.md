# Morgus Skill: PRD to Prototype v2.0

## Description

This skill transforms a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into a working, interactive prototype. Users can provide a PRD in any format (text, markdown, URL), and Morgus will generate a clickable prototype that demonstrates the core user flows and features.

## Core Principles

- **From Words to Wireframes**: Bridge the gap between written requirements and tangible products.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Generate prototypes in minutes, not days.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Allow stakeholders to click through the prototype and provide feedback early.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Parse the PRD**: Morgus ingests the PRD and extracts key information:
    - User stories and personas
    - Core features and functionalities
    - User flows and navigation
    - UI/UX requirements
2.  **Generate Wireframes**: Morgus creates low-fidelity wireframes for each screen or view.
3.  **Create Interactive Components**: Morgus builds interactive components (buttons, forms, menus) for the prototype.
4.  **Assemble the Prototype**: Morgus assembles the wireframes and components into a clickable prototype.
5.  **Deploy the Prototype**: The prototype is deployed to a temporary URL for sharing and feedback.
