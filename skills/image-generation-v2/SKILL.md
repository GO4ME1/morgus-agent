## 🔮 The Morgus Touch: Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Specificity is Key** | The more detailed the prompt, the better the result. We use descriptive language to paint a clear picture for the AI. |
| **Style Matters** | We define the desired artistic style, whether it's photorealistic, cartoonish, or something in between. |
| **Iterate and Refine** | We don't expect perfection on the first try. We generate multiple options and refine the prompt based on the results. |
| **Composition is Crucial** | We consider the arrangement of elements within the image to create a balanced and visually appealing composition. |
| **Harness the Power of Negative Prompts** | We use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements and refine the final image. |

## 🗺️ The Image Generation Workflow

### 1. Deconstruct the Request
- **What is the subject of the image?** (e.g., a person, an animal, a landscape)
- **What is the setting?** (e.g., a forest, a city, a beach)
- **What is the mood or tone?** (e.g., happy, sad, mysterious)
- **What is the desired artistic style?** (e.g., photorealistic, impressionistic, surreal)

### 2. Craft the Prompt
- **Use descriptive adjectives and adverbs:** (e.g., "a majestic lion with a flowing mane," "a serene forest with dappled sunlight")
- **Specify the camera angle and lighting:** (e.g., "a low-angle shot with dramatic backlighting")
- **Include artistic influences:** (e.g., "in the style of Vincent van Gogh," "inspired by the work of Ansel Adams")

### 3. Generate and Iterate
- **Use the `generate` tool:** This tool allows you to create images from text prompts.
- **Generate multiple options:** This will give you a range of possibilities to choose from.
- **Refine the prompt:** Based on the results, adjust the prompt to get closer to your desired outcome.

### 4. Post-Processing (Optional)
- **Use image editing software:** Tools like Photoshop or GIMP can be used to make minor adjustments to the final image.
- **Apply filters and effects:** This can be a quick way to enhance the mood and style of the image.
