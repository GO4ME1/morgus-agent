   - Includes: code generation, environment setup, UI scaffolding, and integration tasks
   - Uses Expo + React Native + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Drizzle + MySQL/TiDB + Manus-Oauth

2. **Natural Language Application Definition**
   - Define features, UI components, business logic, and integrations in simple text
   - Manus creates and assembles the application code

3. **Holistic Workflow**
   - Not just code fragments but complete, running applications
   - Environment setup included
   - UI scaffolding automated
   - Integration tasks handled

### Technology Stack (from Manus docs):

## Slideshow / Presentation Features

### Nano Banana Pro (Image-Based Slides)
- Creates visually stunning presentations using image generation
- Each slide is a complete image (high visual quality)
- **NEW: Now Editable!** (as of Dec 18, 2025)

### Editable Slides Features:
1. **Edit text** with high-quality rendering that matches original design
2. **Point and edit visual elements** to make local changes to any part of a slide
3. **Before and after results** - refine specific elements without regenerating entire slide
4. **Bulk edits** - select multiple areas and process across slide

### How It Works:
1. Create presentation using Manus with nano banana Pro (image generation mode)
2. Select the slide you want to edit
3. Click on any part of the slide to edit
4. Make changes using point-and-click controls
5. Save - slide updates while preserving visual quality

### Key Innovation:
- Eliminates the compromise between visual excellence and editability
- No more choosing between beautiful slides and easy edits
- Make targeted changes without regenerating entire slides
- Combines AI speed with design precision

## Design View (New in 1.6)

### Features:
- Interactive interface for visual editing
- Point-and-click editing instead of text commands
- Change colors, text, and structural elements with simple input
- Bridges gap between instructional text and design creativity

### Benefits:
- Greater precision for designers
- Makes Manus effective for both designers and developers
- Transforms AI from asynchronous text machine to interactive visual assistant
