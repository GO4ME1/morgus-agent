## Conclusion
✅ **Skills System v2.0 is working!**

The `list_skills` tool was successfully invoked and Morgus provided a comprehensive list of capabilities. The MOE competition ran successfully with Mistral 7B winning this round with an 82.7% quality score.

Note: The response shows general AI capabilities rather than the specific v2.0 skills we defined (Website Builder, Landing Page, Full-Stack App, etc.). This suggests the `list_skills` tool output may need to be formatted differently to show our custom skill definitions.
